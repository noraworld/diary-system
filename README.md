# Diary
Simple diary application. Unlike a blog, this application is suitable for writing everyday life, events, thoughts and other miscellaneous contents daily in a sense of diary.

## Setup
You should create a new user to post your diary.

```
$ bundle exec rails diary:create_user
```
```
Create a new user
username: alice
password: (Not shown)

Created a new user: alice
```

You can now sign in with username and password that you set up in `/login` page. In production environment, run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails diary:create_user` instead of `bundle exec rails diary:create_user`.

## Environment Variables
The environment variables are under the control of `.env` file. Copy `.env.sample` and rename it as `.env`. Then replace the environment variables with your own environment.

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

```Ruby
SECRET_KEY_BASE='random string'
```

### Secret Key Base
`SECRET_KEY_BASE` is a random string for the secret key base of production environment. The secret key base can be generated by running the following command.

```
$ bundle exec rails secret
```

Copy the string generated by the command above and paste it to `SECRET_KEY_BASE`. This environment is unnecessary for development environment.

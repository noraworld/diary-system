# For production environment
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails diary:create_user
```
```
Create a new user

password: (Not shown)

Created a new user: alice
```

You can now sign in with username and password that you set up in `/login` page.

## Environment Variables
The environment variables are under the control of `.env` file. Copy `.env.sample` and rename it as `.env`. Then replace the environment variables with your own environment.

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

### Secret Key Base (required)

```
$ bundle exec rails secret
```

Copy the string generated by the command above and paste it to `SECRET_KEY_BASE`. This environment is unnecessary for development environment.
